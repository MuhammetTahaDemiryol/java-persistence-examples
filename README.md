# Java-Persistence-Example
- [x] In this repo I have tried to showcase my knowledge on Java Persistence API.

  
## Spring-Boot-JDBC
- [x] In this project I have used `Spring-Boot-Starter-JDBC` to connect to the database and perform CRUD operations.
- [x] The JDBC template is used to perform the operations.
- [x] `The difference of jdbc from jpa is that in jdbc we have to write the queries and the code to perform the operations.`

## Spring-Boot-JPA
- [x] In this project I have used `Spring-Boot-Starter-Data-JPA` to connect to the database and perform CRUD operations.
- [x] The entityManager is used to perform the operations.
- [x] `The difference of jpa from jdbc is jpa is an abstraction over jdbc and we don't have to write the queries and the code to perform the operations.`


## Spring-Boot-Starter-Data-JPA
- [x] In this project I have used `Spring-Boot-Starter-Data-JPA` to connect to the database and perform CRUD operations.
- [x] This project showcases the easiness of using Spring-Boot-Starter-Data-JPA.
- [x] `With extending only the JpaRepository we can perform the CRUD operations.`
